# GolfSync Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement GolfSync as a comprehensive golf course management platform within the SwiftWare focus-based architecture. GolfSync transforms how private golf clubs, public courses, and resorts operate their daily tee sheet operations, featuring smart scheduling, member management, revenue tracking, and multi-tenant architecture with independent branding.

## Current Architecture Analysis

The SwiftWare application uses a focus-based system where:

- Focus areas are defined in `src/lib/useFocus.ts` (FocusKey type includes "tee-sheet")
- Content is stored in JSON files under `content/{focus}.json`
- Components are organized in `src/components/{focus}/` directories
- Focus switching is handled by `FocusAwareHome.tsx` and `FocusContext`
- Content loading is managed by `src/lib/focusContent.ts`

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Content & Type Definitions

**Goal**: Define the GolfSync content structure and integrate it into the focus system

**Files to Create/Modify:**

- `content/tee-sheet.json` - GolfSync content data following FocusContent interface
- `src/lib/focusContent.ts` - Add tee-sheet case to `getContentForFocusClient()` function

**Content Structure Requirements:**

- Hero section: Interactive golf course dashboard (no traditional text hero)
- Capabilities: Organized as golf course "stations" - Pro Shop, Tee Box, Fairway, Green, Clubhouse
- Outcomes: Golf-specific metrics (rounds per day, member satisfaction, cart utilization)
- FAQ: Golf course management and member experience questions
- Modules: Golf course operational modules (TeeTimeScheduler, MemberPortal, CartManagement)

### Phase 2A: Golf Course Hero Experience

**Goal**: Create a completely unique golf-focused hero that showcases tee sheet operations visually

**Files to Create:**

- `src/components/tee-sheet/GolfCourseHero.tsx` - Interactive golf course visualization hero
- `src/components/tee-sheet/components/TeeTimeGrid.tsx` - Live tee time scheduling grid
- `src/components/tee-sheet/components/CourseLayout.tsx` - Interactive 18-hole course map
- `src/components/tee-sheet/components/WeatherWidget.tsx` - Real-time weather conditions
- `src/components/tee-sheet/index.ts` - Barrel exports for tee-sheet components

**Unique Hero Concept - Interactive Golf Course Dashboard:**

Instead of following the CRM hero pattern, create a golf course operations dashboard that serves as the hero:

- **Live Tee Sheet Grid**: Interactive 18-hole tee time visualization showing real bookings
- **Course Map Integration**: Animated 18-hole course layout with hole-by-hole status
- **Real-time Operations**: Weather widget, pace-of-play indicators, cart availability
- **Member Activity Feed**: Live booking notifications and member check-ins
- **Revenue Dashboard**: Real-time daily revenue tracking and cart rentals

**Technical Approach:**

- Canvas-based course visualization with SVG hole layouts
- WebSocket simulation for live tee time updates
- CSS Grid for tee sheet time slots with drag-and-drop capability
- Golf-specific color palette (greens, fairway browns, sand trap yellows)
- Mobile-first responsive design with swipe navigation for holes

### Phase 2B: Section Components

**Goal**: Implement GolfSync-specific section components

**Files to Create:**

- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/CapabilitiesSection.tsx` - Golf-specific capabilities visualization
- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/MemberExperienceSection.tsx` - Member management features
- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/TeeSheetManagementSection.tsx` - Core scheduling features
- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/RevenueManagementSection.tsx` - Billing and financial features
- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/EventCoordinationSection.tsx` - Tournament and event management
- `src/components/tee-sheet/sections/OperationsControlSection.tsx` - Pace-of-play and weather integration

**Component Patterns:**

- **Golf Course Themed**: Use golf course hole layouts instead of neural networks
- **Tee-to-Green Visualization**: Capabilities flow from tee to green like a golf hole
- **Golf-Specific Icons**: Golf balls, flags, clubs, carts, scorecards
- **Course Management UI**: Dashboard-style layouts mimicking pro shop systems
- **Seasonal Theming**: Support for different course conditions (summer/winter)

### Phase 2C: Focus Integration

**Goal**: Integrate GolfSync into the focus switching system

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/components/FocusAwareHome.tsx` - Add tee-sheet case to render GolfSync components
- Import and conditionally render GolfSync sections when focus === "tee-sheet"

**Integration Requirements:**

- **Unique Focus Experience**: Create completely different experience from CRM focus
- **Golf Course Dashboard**: Replace traditional sections with golf operations dashboard
- **Interactive Tee Sheet**: Primary interface is the live tee time management grid
- **Course-Specific Animations**: Golf ball rolling, flag waving, cart movement animations
- **Golf Terminology**: Use golf-specific language throughout (rounds, tee times, handicaps)

### Phase 3: Golf Course Branding & Customization

**Goal**: Implement course-specific branding that reflects each golf facility's unique identity

**Files to Create:**

- `src/lib/golfCourseThemes.ts` - Golf course theme configuration system
- `src/types/golfCourseConfig.ts` - Course-specific configuration types
- `src/components/tee-sheet/components/CourseIdentity.tsx` - Course branding component
- `src/components/tee-sheet/components/CourseSelector.tsx` - Multi-course selection interface

**Golf Course Branding Features:**

- **Course Personality**: Desert, Links, Parkland, Mountain course themes
- **Signature Hole Showcase**: Featured hole photography and descriptions
- **Course Statistics**: Par, yardage, slope rating, course record
- **Seasonal Variations**: Course appearance changes by season
